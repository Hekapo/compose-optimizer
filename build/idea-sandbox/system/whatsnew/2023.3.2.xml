            <p>
            You can now use Android Studio to build an app that implements Generative AI using the
            <a href="http://ai.google.dev/tutorials/android_quickstart?utm_source=android&utm_medium=referral">Google AI SDK</a>.
            The Gemini API template in Android Studio lets you incorporate AI-powered features, such
            as those that rely on text generation and image recognition, in your app to delight your
            users.

            <p>
            Android Studio offers the ability to launch Android Studio in Safe Mode. This mode can
            be useful if you run into a situation where certain features don't work or the entire
            IDE fails to launch. Using Safe Mode temporarily returns the IDE to a set of default
            configurations that might allow it to launch, so that you can troubleshoot from there to
            identify the issue and restore functionality.
